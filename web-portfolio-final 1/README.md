Challenges and Overcomes:

At the begining I designed a high-fiedality in Xd for my web-portfolio and I always talk about this project to my prof David.He always try to help me to design well because it is my first business website.This website has a lot pages but my profs recomended me to design Three pages.
But I design Four pages.After feedback of my profs ( Rob and David), I tried to redesign and change a few things.Such as tag bar and nav bar.
In future, this website has more detail but now it is a kind of portfolio and website. I linked my personal website to this one that I designed.
In this semester, I learned how to use Bootstrap and many detail about coding. by adding id and #id to the HTML file, I am able to redirect the user to the specific section of another page. For example: PHOTOGRAPHY will redirect the user to portfolio page and PHOTOGRAPHY section.
On my portfolio page, I wanted to expand the images that I put from my works. So people could see details better. I found https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css framework that allowed me to add this feature to my images.
I also wanted to add my resume as a pdf file in my contact page which I've never done before. I could add it using href like this:
