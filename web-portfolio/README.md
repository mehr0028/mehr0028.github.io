Challenges and Overcomes:

At the begining I designed a high-fiedality in Xd for my web-portfolio and I always talk about this project to my prof David.He always try to help me to design well because it is my first business website.This website has a lot pages but my profs recomended me to design Three pages for this project.
But I designed Four pages.After feedback of my profs ( Rob and David), I tried to redesign and change a few things.Such as tag bar and nav bar and so on.
In future, this website has more details but now it is a kind of portfolio and website. I linked my personal website to this one that I designed before.
In this semester, I learned how to use Bootstrap and many detail about coding. 
I used these website for icon, font and framework such as: https://kit.fontawesome.com/96e307a3ff.js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
