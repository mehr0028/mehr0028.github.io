Obstacles and Victories:

I started by designing a high-fidelity in Xd for my web-portfolio, and I've always spoken to my prof David about it.

Since this is my first business website, he still tries to assist me in creating a good template.

Although this website has several pages, my professors advised me to build only three for this project.

However, I created four sites. I tried to redesign and alter a few items after receiving input from my professors (Rob and David). Label bars and navigation bars, for example.
This website will have more information in the future, but for now it serves as a portfolio and website. I connected my personal website to the one I previously designed.
This semester, I learned how to use Bootstrap and a variety of coding techniques.
These are what I used.
I used these website for icon, font and framework such as: https://kit.fontawesome.com/96e307a3ff.js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js
All photos were created by me and my daughter, who works as an industrial designer.
Thanks a lot to Rob and David, my professors, for their assistance and for being my professors.
